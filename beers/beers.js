    "description": "While pale ale beer has definitively English roots, many credit the American take on the style to the advent of Sierra Nevada Pale Ale, which employs the use of American Cascade hops and a clean fermenting ale yeast that has become synonymous with todayâ€™s West Coast style craft beers. Currently, pale ales offer beer fans a balance between malt and hops, which make pale ales one of the most enjoyed and approachable beer styles available.",

    "description": "India Pale Ale, the modern version of which has largely been formed in the US, has an intense hop flavor, a golden to copper color, and a medium malty body. The aroma is moderate to very strong. IPAs work especially well at cutting the heat of chili, vindaloo or Sichuan cuisine. In England, IPA is often just another name for bitter although some micros are doing their own versions of an American IPA as well",

    "description": "Imperial IPA, also called Double or Triple IPA, is a strong often sweet intensely hoppy version of the traditional India Pale Ale. The ABV level for this style generally begins at 7.5% but is more commonly in the 8.0%+ range. The flavour profile is intense all around. Unlike barley wines, the balance is heavily towards the hops, with crystal and other malts providing support.",
